# Advanced Inventory Management System with Invoicing
## Project Overview
The **Advanced Inventory Management System with Invoicing** is a class-based Python application designed to manage inventory effectively. The application includes features for tracking sales, returns, and generating invoices in PDF format.

## Objectives
Develop a robust system for managing inventory, sales, returns, and invoicing.
Implement a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
Ensure the application is well-documented and easy to maintain.
## Requirements
## 1. Class Design
**Product:** Represents individual products in the inventory.

**Inventory:** Manages the collection of products.

**Transaction:** Base class for handling sales and returns.

**Sale:** Inherits from Transaction, handles sales transactions.

**Returns:** Inherits from Transaction, handles return transactions.

Invoice: Generates PDF invoices for sales transactions.
## 2. Inventory Management
**View Products:** Method to view all available products with their quantities.  
**APIs for Inventory Management:**  
-->Add products  
-->Update product details  
-->Remove products from inventory  
**Product Tracking:**  
-->Track quantities  
-->Track prices  
-->Track categories  
## 3. Sales and Returns Tracking    
**Sales Recording:** Record details such as product ID, quantity sold, sale price, and date.  
**Returns Recording:** Record details such as product ID, quantity returned, reason for return, and date.  
**Inventory Updates:** Automatically update inventory quantities based on sales and returns.  
## 4. Invoice Generation  
**Generate Invoices:** Create PDF invoices for sales transactions.  
-->Include product names, quantities, prices, total amount, and transaction date.  
**Invoice Tracking:** List all invoices generated for a specific product or customer.  
## 5. User Interface  
**Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides a simple interface for interacting with the system.  
Commands for adding products, recording sales, creating invoices, etc.
## 6. Documentation
**Code Comments and Docstrings:** Ensure the code is well-commented and includes docstrings to explain the logic and functionality.
# How to Use
